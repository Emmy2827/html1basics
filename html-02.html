    <h1 class="center">Things to Do in London Ontario: Treetop Trekking</h1>
   <center> <img src="https://photos.smugmug.com/Canada/Ontario/London-2019/i-pqgQMLh/0/dab4e1cc/XL/P1400102-XL.jpg";></center>
    <p class="center";style="font-size: 5vw;"> Did you know that London, Ontario is known as the “Forest City”? London’s roots are very green, indeed. Back in its early days, it was a city in the middle of a dense forest. There were vast expanses of greenery and trees as far as you could see.</p>

</div>
<div>
        <p class="center";style="font-size:5vw">
            While construction and development may have diminished some of the trees, London has plans to maintain its Forest City moniker. For every 1500 trees that are chopped down due to poor health, the city replants 5000 trees. If you’d like to explore one of the city’s green spaces, head directly to Boler Mountain. In fact, this is one of the most unique and fun outdoor activities in London Ontario: you’ll be right up in the trees!
        </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p class="center";style="font-size:5vw">
        The treetop adventure park at Boler Mountain is a great place to connect with nature and get some exercise. By winter, Boler Mountain is a ski park. By summer, there are non-stop adventures in its natural Carolinian forest. There are five ropes courses for all ages and abilities. I participated in the beginner, intermediate, and zip line course. Watch the video below to see my treetop trekking skills in action!

    <p id="para2"; class="center";style="font-size: 5vw;"> 
        Treetop trekking adventures at Boler Mountain are so much fun, and it’s one of the greatest outdoor activities in London Ontario. Reconnect with nature as you hop and swing through the trees. I was challenged by each apparatus that I encountered. It was interesting to figure out how I was going to swing from one platform to the next.
    </p>


</div>
<div>
    <p class="center";style="font-size: 5vw;">
        Some of the platforms and planks were easier to navigate than others. There was one circular bit of wood that unexpectedly spun when I stepped on it, so I completely lost my balance and flew up into the air. But, that’s no problem at all! You are safely connected with harnesses and cables, so you can quite literally hang out up there while staying 100% safe.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p class="center";style="font-size:5vw">
        As you can see in the video above, I got to fly through the air on a Tarzan swing right into a pirate net. Of course, I missed grabbing onto the net and flew backwards into the middle of the course. Not to worry: there are staff members positioned at spots throughout the course. This particular staff member was quite helpful in describing how to climb out of my situation!

<!--Indoor Activities in London Ontario: Rec Room (paragraph)-->

    <h1 class="center">Indoor Activities in London Ontario: Rec Room</h1>
    <p class="center";style="font-size:5vw">The Rec Room is 30,000 square feet of games, food, and fun in London’s Masonville Place. If you’re seeking indoor activities in London Ontario at night or on a rainy day, gather your pals and head straight to the Rec Room. Justin and I love playing video games, so we were pretty pumped to visit the Rec Room for the first time.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p class="center";style="font-size:5vw">
        You’ll find tons of brand new games and fun activities at the Rec Room. There are modern video games (four player Mario Kart, anyone?), redemption games, ping pong, pool, virtual reality, and even axe throwing. The two of us played lots of video games and redemption games. We even amassed enough points by the end of the evening that we came away with some boxes of candy.

    <h1 class="center">Playing Games at the Rec Room</h1>
    <p class="center";style="font-size:5vw">
        It’s easy to play games at the Rec Room. Add credits to a wrist band. Hold your wrist band up to the game that you’d like to play. That’s it! Any points that you earn from redemption games are stored on your wrist band. You can keep your wrist band and save your points or redeem them in the shop at the end of the night.

        Our favorite game was one that combined air hockey and Pac-Man. We’d both never seen it anywhere else before. The game starts off quite normally. We were hitting an air hockey puck back and forth, trying to score on each other’s goal. After a couple of goals, a panel at the side of the game unleashed a fury of pucks on our game.
    </p>
</div> 
<div>
    <p class="center";style="font-size:5vw">
        Dozens of smaller pucks spilled onto the game field and chaos ensued. There were pucks flying around everywhere. I was doubling over with laughter. I really don’t think that I’ve laughed that hard in a long time. After a couple of moments passed, more miniature pucks fell down. And more of them again. I think our final score was something like 91-77, which is insanely high for a game of air hockey. You’ve gotta try it when you go to the Rec Room!
